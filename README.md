# Stripe Demo
This was to learn Stripe for the first time when I was working for a client who needed Stripe integration to process payments on their platform. I learned a lot about Stripe's API as well as webhooks for the first time. Both skills have been helpful to me since this project. And I successfully implemented Stripe to process customer payments on the client's platform.
